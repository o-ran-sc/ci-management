To further reduce redundancy in this long file I suggest defining oam_common with this content, like this:\n\n    - oam_common: \u0026oam_common\n        name: oam-common\n        project: oam\n        project-name: oam\n        mvn-settings: oam-settings\n        java-version: openjdk8\n        maven-version: mvn35\n\nThen use that basically *everywhere* and remove the corresponding entries for example\n\n    \u003c\u003c: *oam_common\n    \u003c\u003c: *oam_parent_common\n\nI chose to put project-name in that super common block, but you will have to override it in most places.",

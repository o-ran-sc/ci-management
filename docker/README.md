# Docker build images for O-RAN-SC at LF

This area contains Dockerfiles to assemble images that are used to
compile source and create binary artifacts such as Docker images for
O-RAN-SC software features.  This approach replaces the common
practice at LF of installing and maintaining specialty software on
Jenkins build minions.  Instead the only required package is Docker.

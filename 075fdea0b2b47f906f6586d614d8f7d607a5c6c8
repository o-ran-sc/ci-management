However, since the TSC has approved it we\u0027ll go ahead.\n\nA side note. LF Release Engineering requires Non-Author-Code-Review (NACR) for any ci-management repository that has community members in it. This means that the author of the change is _required_ to get the approval of a committer that is not themselves. Basically, this policy blocks a committer from doing self-review and merging.\n\nSubsequently we\u0027ve enabled NACR on this repository.",

Now that I look at this a bit more closely, I see that using the sim_e2_interface_docker anchor pulls in many key-value pairs that are wrong for the release job.  But they are probably ignored and the job will probably work as defined here.  If would like, I can coach you thru further cleanup, but I will not block merge. Please let me know.",

      "message": "Will do.   One of my biggest gripes (specifically with python programmers, but it probably isn\u0027t limited to their community) is the complete anal-retentive nature with trailing whitespace.  I don\u0027t buy the \u0027wastes space on the disk\u0027 argument because if that were the case then they should trash every CTL-M that precedes a newline when they edit in DOS/Windoz!  I don\u0027t know who first thought it was a crime, but it seems that a programmer\u0027s time is better spent doing things other than sweeping up the crumbs :)        End rant, and given that it serves to prevent a -1 for such a thing I\u0027ll adjust.     On a related note.... .md files must drive them buggy given that trailing white space is an indicator, but don\u0027t get me started about using white space to carry meaning!!",

The job will fail if there is no file to fetch, even if the project itself is not having any settings. These files are also needed to pass on repository locations and credentials for deliverables \n",

Originally, when the files were there, there was a build failure due to missing credentials (understandably). Since I am not sure how to add those credentials, tried this approach similar to how `ric-plt-xapp-frame-cpp`.",

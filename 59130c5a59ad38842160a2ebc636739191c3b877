The job will fail if there is no file to fetch, even if the project itself is not having any settings.

      "message": "There are two questions here - \n\n1. `ric-plt-xapp-frame-cpp` does something similar and perhaps that works. OR\n\n2. How to add credentials specific to your project. Originally, when the files were there, there was a build failure due to missing credentials (understandably). Since I am not sure how to add those credentials, tried this approach similar to how `ric-plt-xapp-frame-cpp`.",

      "message": "No problem, this sounds like the credentials either got missed in Jenkins or they do not have the correct password assigned. \nThese files basically just call the credential but will not be able to point out if there is something wrong with them. They will only fail if the actual credential in Jenkins is missing. \n\nDo you have a JSD where you reported the build failure. I can look into the actual build failure if you have one and work on a fix.",

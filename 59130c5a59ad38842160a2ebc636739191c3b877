The job will fail if there is no file to fetch, even if the project itself is not having any settings.

      "message": "There are two questions here - \n\n1. `ric-plt-xapp-frame-cpp` does something similar and perhaps that works. OR\n\n2. How to add credentials specific to your project. Originally, when the files were there, there was a build failure due to missing credentials (understandably). Since I am not sure how to add those credentials, tried this approach similar to how `ric-plt-xapp-frame-cpp`.",

They will only fail if the actual credential in Jenkins is missing. \n\nDo you have a JSD where you reported the build failure. I can look into the actual build failure if you have one and work on a fix.",

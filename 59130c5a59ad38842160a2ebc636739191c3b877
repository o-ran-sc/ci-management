Originally, when the files were there, there was a build failure due to missing credentials (understandably). Since I am not sure how to add those credentials, tried this approach similar to how `ric-plt-xapp-frame-cpp`.",

They will only fail if the actual credential in Jenkins is missing. \n\nDo you have a JSD where you reported the build failure. I can look into the actual build failure if you have one and work on a fix.",
